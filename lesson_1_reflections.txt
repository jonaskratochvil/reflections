We would like to save a version whenever we want to 

Git: Any editor, offline, manual save 

commit - each commit represents a different version in time  

diff commit - compares two ids of commits

repository - multiple files that we want to keep track of together (e.g. CSV, HTML making together a website)
		   - if you make a commit you change all your files in repository

git clone - we don't want to download just the latest version of a repository but also all previous commits within this repository
		  - just type git clone and than for example a link to github
		  - by cd we can go into it and by typing git log we see all changes
		  - type git diff to compare two previous versions just git diff id1 id2
		  - type git config --global color.ui auto for color highliting

git checkout - temporary restore to previous version

git init - inicialize a new repository. Only files from that directory (and subdirectories inside that directory) will be contained in that repository 

git status - status of your repository

working directory -> staging area (by running git add "name")-> repository (commit all files from stage together)
git reset resets a file from staging area back to working directory

git commit - commits from staging area - Sublime will automatically open so that you can write a message of changes

git diff - compares working directory with staging area
git diff -- staged compares staging area and commit 1
git diff commit1 commit 2 compares two comits

branches - sometimes you want to branch out the versions of your files (use git branch "easy"    ->    git checkout "easy")

merging - process of combining two braches
